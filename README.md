# NotUber

NotUber is a simulation of a ride-hailing system that implements various graph algorithms to match riders and drivers efficiently.

## Features

### T1: Simple Queue-Based Matching
- Matches riders and drivers using a basic FIFO queue system.

### T2: Proximity-Based Driver Assignment
- Matches riders with the nearest available driver using shortest path algorithms.

### T3: Network Traversal Time Optimization
- Optimizes the travel time between riders and drivers

### T4: Efficiency Improvements
- Utilizes KD-Tree and hypergraph to decrease empirical runtime 100x

### T5: Proprietary Enhanced Scheduling
- T4 + additional heurestics for drivers to select rides while considering future implications of drop-off location
